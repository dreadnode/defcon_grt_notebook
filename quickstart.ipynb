    "This notebook shows you how to submit to [the GRT]() - it gets you going with your first large language model (LLM) evaluation, eliciting toxic responses (_really_ toxic responses) from OLMo, an LLM from the Allen Institute for AI. It uses [Inspect](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/), the AI Safety Institute's framework for LLM evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **LLM evaluation** consists of three things: \n",
    "1. a set of tasks\n",
    "2. a plan for using the LLM to execute those tasks and\n",
    "3. an approach to grading the LLM's performance on the tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluations can be used to measure performance on all sorts of sets of task, but for the GRT we're inviting you to create evaluations that reveal flaws in OLMo's behaviour, contradicting the intended behaviour described by its [model card](https://github.com/ul-dsri/olmo-defcon32/blob/main/model_card.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea to developing an LLM evaluation, like with programming, is ✨ experimental refinement ✨ - interact with the model, get a feel for where it falls down, and iteratively build out an evaluation that demonstrates one of its failure modes. You can get ideas for failure modes you could test for from [this great paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04359) from a team at Google Deepmind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you don't want the chit-chat and just want the code you need to compete, then you should go straight to the `boilerplate.py` script and check out the examples of misuse prompts in the `harmbench_behaviours...` csv files!**\n",
